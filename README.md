# 🎄 Advent of Code — Agents Edition 🎄

### What is [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)?
*"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like."*

For this year's edition, there are 12 days, 24 puzzles in total.

This document describes a custom variation designed for exploring and improving the use of AI agents. You’ll still work with the puzzles from this 2025’s Advent of Code, but with added constraints and goals focused on prompt engineering.
