# Git Commit Configuration

When making git commits, agents must use the following identity for both author and committer:

- **Name**: "PuzzleSolverAgent"
- **Email**: "puzzle-solver-agent@aoc.com"

Configure git before committing to set both author and committer:
```bash
git config user.name "PuzzleSolverAgent"
git config user.email "puzzle-solver-agent@aoc.com"
```

Or use the `--author` flag in commit commands (this sets the author, but committer will use git config):
```bash
git commit --author="PuzzleSolverAgent <puzzle-solver-agent@aoc.com>" -m "commit message"
```

To ensure both author and committer match, configure git config as shown above before making commits. If you need to amend existing commits to update the committer, use:
```bash
git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit
```
